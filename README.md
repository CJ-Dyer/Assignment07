## Description ##
This is a simple 2D game, where you type the words as they fall down the screen. You lose points for missing words and gain them for getting words.

## Features ##
* Multiple scenes:
* Intro scene contains instructions on how to play. Players can enter their name and adjust settings from here as well.
* Main Scene contains most of the gameplay. Keeps track of score, displays name, and settings.
* End Scene contains the score from the LAST game as well as the overall high scores. From here you can play again, go back to the main menu to adjust settings, or exit the game.

## Known Issues ##
* Words that are missed become unable to type at all again. After working on this all week, I have increased the amount of words that can spawn as a bandage fix. Until then I’ve changed the name to “Word Fall Hardcore” and made it seem like a feature, the Bethesda approach.
